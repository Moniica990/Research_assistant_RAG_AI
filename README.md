# research_assistant_RAG_AI


This project implements a research assistant tool that allows users to upload and analyze scientific publications related to machine learning, particularly focusing on techniques for handling class imbalance (such as SMOTE) and related topics. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) and embeddings to retrieve relevant information from uploaded documents, enabling users to ask questions and receive answers supported by the research content. The tool is designed to streamline literature review and knowledge extraction for researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence.
